Now what?Let's take a step-by-step tour through your WordPress site and see how the different functions work and how to make your new site your own. During the first part of this tutorial, please don't change anything within the program unless it is part of the tutorial. After following these steps, you'll soon be changing everything.Log InView Log In FormBegin by logging into the “administration area” or the back end of your website. Visit your site's login page by placing "wp-admin" after your domain name (e.g. http://example.com/wp-admin). You can also place "login" after your domain as of WordPress 3.4. Some themes provide a "log in" link or form on the front end as well. Now log into WordPress using your username and password.Start at the TopView Site LinkAfter logging in you are on the main Administration Screen called the Dashboard. This is the brain behind your website, the place where you can let your creativity explode, writing brilliant prose and designing the best and most lovely website possible. This is where the organization of your site begins - and this is just the start.At the top of the screen is the area called the "toolbar." Click on the link that is your site name. This will take you to a view of your new WordPress site. Like it? Don't like it? Doesn't matter, just look at it. This is where you are going to be spending a lot of time over the next few minutes, hours, weeks, months....Test Drive Your WordPress Sitetwentytwelvedefault1.pngTake time to look at the site before you get into the changing of things and figuring out how all of this works; it's important to see how the WordPress Twenty Fourteen theme is laid out and works. Consider this the test drive before you start adding on all the special features.The layout you are looking at is called a WordPress Theme. It is the appearance of your website, styling the look of the site and the framing of the content. The WordPress Twenty Fourteen theme features a "header" at the top with the title and tagline for your site. Below this is your Menu. Along the side you will see some titles and links. This comprises Widgets. Within the main middle section of the page is the content area. At the bottom of the page is the footer.Let's look at the post for a moment. There is a "title," and below the title is date the post was written, then the body of the post, and finally some information about the post. This is called the post meta data and contains information about the post such as the category assigned to that post.Scroll down the page and notice the bar at the end of the page. This is called the "footer." It says "Proudly powered by WordPress."Back to the sidebar, you will see different sections with information. Among these you may find a list of Recent Posts, Recent Comments, Archives, Categories, and links to the Administration Screens, Log Out, and RSS feeds. This is part of the menu or navigation Screen that people will use to move around your site, visiting posts from different categories or time periods.It's All in the DetailsTake time to notice the smaller details of this web page layout and design. Move your mouse over the title of the article post. Notice how it changes color. This is called a hover. Most Themes feature a distinctive color or underline when you move your mouse over a link. Move your mouse over any of the links in the sidebar. Do they change? Is the change the same? You can change your link hovers to look different in different sections of your page. Also look at the color of the links. How are they colored or underlined to stand out from the rest of the text?Observe the small design details and where they are placed within the page. In the near future, you may want to change some of these details, such as the color of the title in the white box at the top of the page. If you remember that is called the header then you will know to look within the header section of your style sheet, the file that controls the look of your web page, when you want to make changes to it.Take a Quick Trip AroundFor now you only have one post. It is residing within a page that is laid out as your home page or the front page. If you click on the title of the post, it will take you to the specific page for that post. The first page or home page of your site features the most recent posts on your site. Each post title will link to the actual page of the post. Some Theme designers design their single post pages to look different from the home page. By clicking on the title, you are taken to another web page that looks different from the home page.Again, in the single post, pay attention to the layout and notice what is now different about the design elements. Is the header different? Smaller, larger, or a different color? Is there a sidebar?Posts are usually stored in Categories and/or Tags so you can keep related topics together. Right now you only have one category, but will soon want more. Click on the single category that appears in the sidebar of the home page. You are now in a page that has been generated to display only the posts within that category. Again, take a look at the layout and see how it may be different from the home page and the single post.Do the same with the Archives. You may only have one post, but look at how the pages are laid out. They may or may not change, but look at all of it to see how it all works.All of these changes are created from only a few files called template files and you can learn more about how they work in Stepping Into Templates. For now, however, let's get on with how the rest of WordPress works.Test Drive the WordPress Administration ScreensWordPress Admin DashboardNow that you have an idea of how your site looks and what the different layout sections are called, it's time to test drive the WordPress Administration. This is like familiarizing yourself with the backend of your new website. In fact, the first page you see after logging in is called the Dashboard, a collection of information and data about the activities and actions on your WordPress site.The Dashboard helps to keep you up to date on new and interesting bits of information from the many WordPress resources. In the corner it also features a list of the most recent activity you've accomplished on your site.On the left side of the screen is the main navigation menu detailing each of the administrative functions you can perform. Move your mouse down the list and the sub-menus will "fly out" for you to move your mouse to and click. Once you choose a "parent" navigation section, it will open up to reveal the options within that section.The various menu items are as follows:    Dashboard    Posts    Media    Links    Pages    Comments    Appearance    Plugins    Users    Tools    SettingsThe links in the above list will take you to a series of articles that will guide you step-by-step through every aspect of the Admin Screens. You are anxious to get started, so for now, let's start with the Users Screen.User Profile ScreenClick on the Users tab. The screen will change and you will see the Screen called All Users that shows a list of all your users; from here you can add or change existing users and authors accounts. In the navigation menu, click on the Your Profile menu choice. This is where you will enter information about you, the author and administrator of the site. Fill in the information and click Update Profile when done.Now, let's look at some other powerful features of the WordPress Admin.Quick Changing the LookThe Appearance ScreenThe Appearance, Themes Screen allows you to change the look of your site using different Themes. Themes are presentation styles that completely change the look of your site. Designed by WordPress developers and users, there are hundreds of themes available for you to choose from. In your Appearance Screen, you will see a list of currently installed themes, including the WordPress Twenty Fourteen theme. To quickly change the theme, simply click on the Activate button under one of the themes listed, then click on your site name in the top toolbar to see how it looks. Wow, you have another look and nothing else on the site has changed. It's that easy.Go back to the Appearance > Theme Screen and click the Activate button under the WordPress Twenty Fourteen theme to bring the design back to what you had. To see it again, click your site name in the toolbar, and there it is.Writing and Managing PostsAdd New Post ScreenBack in the Administration Screen, take a look at the Posts Screen. You can use the tabs under the Posts Menu to write and manage your posts. Let's start by making your first test post in the Add New tab.If the screen looks a little intimidating, the Codex article on Writing a Post will take you step-by-step through the process of writing a post. Take a moment to read through the article and post your first entry and then return to this article and we'll take you onto the next step.If you are in a hurry, then simply fill in the blanks, one by one, in the post beginning with the title and then write a little test message in the post window. This is just for a test, so you can write anything you want. When you are done, click the Publish button that is to the right of the post entry window and it is done. You will then see a blank Write a Post screen and you're ready to write another post. Go ahead. But do only three to four entries. There's more exciting work ahead!Now that you've gotten a feel for writing posts, you can view your posts by clicking your site name in the toolbar at top of the screen. Now it's time to get down to the real work.Planning SessionAll good websites come from a good plan. Sounds redundant, but it's true. If you want to create a good and solid website, you need a good and solid plan. I know it's hard to do, and I know you want to keep poking and playing with this exciting program, but it is time to take a break away from your computer and turn to the old paper and pen. That's right, we're going back in time to when people actually wrote things down.On a piece of notebook paper, or whatever is lying around, describe your site. Take five to twenty minutes to come up with a purpose for your site, or better yet, call it your Mission Statement.Answer the following questions:    What am I going to do with this?    Who is going to read this?    What kinds of information will I be posting?    Why am I doing this?    Who am I doing this for?    How often am I going to be posting and adding information?Now, compile this information into a paragraph so it looks like this:This website will be dedicated to X, Y, and Z,and cover the topics of A, B, and C. The audience willbe __________ ________________ _______. I will be addingposts every _____________ about ________ _______ ______________.I am doing this because _____________ ________.Using the InformationFrom this exercise, we've gathered a lot of information. We've uncovered information on how you might layout and design your site. If you know your audience is mostly made up of young people under the age of 25, you will probably want a fashionable look ranging from wild colors and crazy graphics to dark foreboding tones. Something appropriate for that generation. If you are providing factual information about a serious subject, then you will probably want a more conservative look where the information is more important than a lot of pop and flash.You may already have a design idea in mind, or perhaps you will be copying over from your previous site, but take a moment to use this information to reconsider your design, and to see how what you want will work with the WordPress options.You have also uncovered the possible categories for your site. The topics and subjects you will be covering are listed in your purpose statement. Let's say your purpose statement said,            "The website will be dedicated to providing news and information on computers, web pages, and the internet and cover the topics of computer tips, web page design, and internet news." Your topics are your categories. Write your categories down below your purpose paragraph and notes about your web page design.Now, what subcategories might be under these topics? Under Computer Tips, you might want to segregate them by Windows, Linux, and Mac. Or maybe Software and Hardware. You can have sub-sub-categories, but let's stop with subcategories for right now. Write these down.Remember the question about why you are doing this? Is it because you have valuable and timely information or knowledge to share, because you want to talk about a subject that interests you, or maybe because you just think it will be fun to do. Why not? Everyone's doing it!Understanding the timeliness of the information you want to present on your site helps you organize the information on your website. Your website is organized by several different methods. If the date of when you posted the information is critical to the success of the page, then having links to your posts referenced by date is important. If the information itself is more important and timeless, then having your posts referenced by category is the best choice.Have you noticed that you are starting to lay out your website? If you remember our earlier test drive of your new WordPress website, we examined the sidebar menu. This is the area where your past posts are organized. If you take another look (yes, you can go back to your computer for a moment), you will see the sidebar is laid out in a list, including Archives by date and Categories by category. It may even feature a calendar.As you lay out your website on paper, consider whether you want both categories and dates, or just one of them in your sidebar. What information you have and how you want to help the user find the information is critical to your website design.What Information Do You Want to ShareAs you think about what information the user will need to know, you have to consider what information you are willing to share with them. That information may include how to contact you, what the purpose of the site is, who you are, and what your expertise is.A WordPress feature called Pages makes the process of presenting this information easier. Pages, similar to posts, are most commonly used to present unchanging information such as About Us, Contact Us, Sign Up for Our Mailing List, and other static information. Before creating your individual Pages, you need to think about what information you would like the Page to hold. Write down the possible Page titles and describe the information you are willing to share online on each Page.CommentsPart of the fun of WordPress is the ability to have viewers leave comments on your site. It creates a dynamic interchange between you and the viewer. Do you want comments on your posts? Comments on posts come in a variety of forms, from pats on the back (Good job! Like the post!) to extensive conversations and commentary about the posts. Or maybe you are seeking comments that add to the information you've posted.Responding to comments and moderating them can also take up a lot of time. If they are critical to your site, then include them and consider how you want them presented. Go back to your test site; the first post created at the time of installation includes a sample comment. You can even make a few comments yourself on the posts you created. Take a look at how they are laid out and consider how you might want them to look to fit into the design and layout of your site.When you have reached your decision about how you want to handle comments, take time to read through the article on comments and WordPress discussion options to help you set those features.With this basic information, you are ready to return to your computer and start laying out your site and setting it up.Setting Up Your SiteBefore you get to the graphic look of your site, let's do a little more administration to your site to set it up. Consider making your first plugin installation the Enhanced Admin Bar with Codex Search. It allows you to search both the WordPress Codex and WordPress Support Forum from your WordPress Administration Screens. Click on one of the search results and the page will open in a new window or tab so you can have the article or discussion open while working on WordPress. This will make your transition to WordPress a much gentler one with information right at your fingertips. You can also work from this page by clicking on a link with a Right Click and opening the documents in a new window or tab, so you can read along as you work on your site.You may also want to install plugins such as Jetpack by WordPress.com to supercharge your website, and don't forget to activate the Akismet WordPress Plugin that is available with all WordPress sites to help protect it from comment spam.But now, let's start with making those categories you wrote down before.Create CategoriesIn the Posts > Categories tab, in the Add New Category area, fill in the information about your category. Continue to add your parent categories, going down the list. Hold off on entering subcategories until all the main categories are entered.        NOTE: You can add any new categories at any time, but make a note of the fact that categories can be sorted in WordPress in two ways: by name (alphabetically) or by ID number. As you enter the categories, they are assigned an ID number. It is difficult to change this, so if you don't want your categories sorted alphabetically, enter them in the order you want to see them presented on the screen. WordPress Admin CategoriesWhen you have the parent categories entered, enter your subcategories. In the pull down menu for Parent Category, you can select the parent to the subcategory you are adding. When you view your categories in the Manage > Categories Screen, you will see the categories listed like this:Computer Tips    - Windows    - Linux    - MacInternet NewsWeb Page Design    - Web Standards    - WordPress        - - Plugins        - - ThemesPut Posts in CategoriesLet's put some of your test posts into categories so you can see how this works.WordPress Admin PostsFrom the Posts > Category Screen, click on the tab for All Posts. You should see the test posts you entered here. When you hover your mouse over each post title, under the title, you should see the Edit | Quick Edit | Trash | View links. Click on Edit to edit one of the posts. On the right side of the Edit Post screen you will now see your Categories. Choose one of them by clicking in the box next to it. Then in the Publish module above, click the Update button. Repeat this for your other test posts, putting each one in a different category.Now view your page by clicking on your site name in the toolbar at the top of your Administration Screen. Do you see the categories listed in the sidebar now? Great. If you are missing a category, that usually means that there are no posts in it. This is the default function of WordPress, so not to worry. When you add a post to the "missing" category, it will appear on your web pages. Click on one of the categories and you will be taken to a page for just that category. You should see the posts that went into that category. This is a generated Category page.Now, click on the Archives for the month showing. Now you are visiting a generated page of your posts listed in chronological order for this month - well, specifically for today only. Two methods of finding the same information.Preventing SpamThere is more to think about when it comes to having comments on your site. Unfortunately we live in a world where spam is a fact of life. It is recommended that you begin battling the comment spammers with the helpful article, Introduction to Dealing with Comment Spam.What Is NextYou've now done all the basics for your new WordPress website. You know how to write a post, create a category, and how to view your site's information by category and archive. You can start the customization process, and when you are done, don't forget to delete your test posts! Then start writing some wonderful information to share with your new-found public!Customizing Your WordPress SiteOnce you are familiar with how WordPress works, it's time to get creative and start customizing. The tutorial now splits into different subjects that require no order. From here on you can do whatever you want, adding and subtracting, perfecting and scrambling your site at will. The amount of effort you put into the site is now up to you. You can work with the two WordPress Themes that came with the installation, or seek out another Theme that better meets your needs. Or you can create your own Child Theme. You can totally customize all the links and information, or get serious and completely re-design the entire site to do whatever you want. You have the basics, the rest is up to your imagination.Finding a WordPress Theme    Look for one that better suits the look you desire on your site. Customizing the Look    When you are ready to plunge into the code, you can customize the look and layout of your site through CSS and modifying the Themes (or create your own). If your customizing goals are not seriously extensive, a good bet would be to develop your own Child Theme. A minimal Child Theme is a fairly simple project if you have a little coding experience. Enhance Your Site with Plugins    Plugins add function and sometimes fun to your site. There are hundreds of different plugins from adding custom links like related articles to your sidebar to adding weather reports. Just like Child Themes are an easy way to customize the look of your site, with a bit of coding experience, your own minimal Plugin is an easy way to change how your site works. WordPress ThemesThere are hundreds of WordPress Themes to choose from. All do basically the same thing but graphically present the information in a myriad of ways. Choose a few that look interesting to you, and meet your audience's needs and your desires, and then test drive them following the test drive instructions above. Click through the whole site, the categories and archives as well as the individual posts to see how the Theme handles each one. The look may be nice on the front page, but if it handles things in a way you don't like on the single post, then you will have to dig into the code and make changes. Not ready for that, try another theme.If you run into problems, check out the Codex's Troubleshooting Themes article.Customizing The LookIf you are familiar with CSS, HTML, and even PHP and MySQL, consider either customizing the Theme to your own needs, or creating your own Child Theme. This is not for the timid, this is for the informed and experienced. That said, a Child Theme is an easy, safe way to tinker under the hood/bonnet of WordPress. If things go badly with your customizations, simply activate an approved, unmodified theme and your site is up and running and looking perfectly again.

They are software scripts that add functions and events to your website. They cover the gamut from up-to-date weather reports to simple organization of your posts and categories. Plugins are designed by volunteer contributors and enthusiasts who like challenges and problem solving.

This task is performed by a software, called a crawler or a spider (or Googlebot, as is the case with Google). •	Indexing - is the process of creating index for all the fetched web pages and keeping them into a giant database from where it can later be retrieved. Essentially, the process of indexing is identifying the words and expressions that best describe the page and assigning the page to particular keywords. •	Processing - When a search request comes, the search engine processes it . i.e. it compares the search string in the search request with the indexed pages in the database. Simply Easy LearningCalculating Relevancy - Since it is likely that more than one pages contains the search string, so the search engine starts calculating the relevancy of each of the pages in its index to the search string. • Retrieving Results - The last step in search engines' activities is retrieving the best matched results. Basically, it is nothing more than simply displaying them in the browser. Search engines such as Google and Yahoo! often update their relevancy algorithm dozens of times per month. When you see changes in your rankings it is due to an algorithmic shift or something else outside of your control. Although the basic principle of operation of all search engines is the same, the minor differences between their relevancy algorithms lead to major changes in results relevancy. What is SEO Copywriting? SEO Copywriting is the technique of writing the viewable text on a web page in such a way that it reads well for the surfer, and also targets specific search terms. Its purpose is to rank highly in the search engines for the targeted search terms. As well as the viewable text, SEO Copywriting usually optimizes other on-page elements for the targeted search terms. These include the Title, Description and Keywords tags, headings and alt text. The idea behind SEO Copywriting is that search engines want genuine content pages and not additional pages (often called "doorway pages") that are created for the sole purpose of achieving high rankings. What is Search Engine Rank? When you search any keyword using a search engine then it displays thousands of results found in its database. A page ranking is measured by the position of web pages displayed in the search engine results. If Search engine is putting your web page on first position then your web page rank will be number 1 and it will be assumed as with a high rank. SEO is the process of designing and developing a web site to attend a high rank in search engine results. What is on-page and off-page SEO? Conceptually, there are two ways of doing SEO •	On-Page SEO- This includes providing good content, good keywords selection, putting keywords on correct places, giving appropriate title to every page etc. •	Off-Page SEO - This includes link building, increasing link popularity by submitting in open directories, search engines, link exchange etc.  	 2 SEO Tactics and Methods SEO techniques are classified into two broad categories: 1.	Techniques that search engines recommend as part of good design referred to as White Hat SEO, and 2.	Techniques that search engines do not approve and attempt to minimize the effect of referred to as Black Hat or spamdexing. White Hat SEO An SEO tactic, technique or method is considered as White Hat if it follows the followings •	If it conforms to the search engine's guidelines. •	If it does not involves any deception. •	It ensures that the content a search engine indexes and subsequently ranks is the same content a user will see. •	It ensures that a Web Page content should have been created for the users and not just for the search engines. •	It ensures the good quality of the web pages •	It ensures the useful content available on the web pages Always follow a White Hat SEO tactic and don't try to fool your site visitors. Be honest and definitely you will get something more. Next chapter onward we will put light on White Hap SEO techniques. The WHST are very simple and can be done without investing much cost. Black Hat or Spamdexing An SEO tactic, technique or method is considered as Black Hat or Spamdexing if it follows the followings •	Try to improve rankings that are disapproved of by the search engines and/or involve deception. •	Redirecting users from a page that is built for search engines to one that is more human friendly. Redirecting users to a page that was different from the page the Search Engine ranked. •	Serving one version of a page to search engine spiders/bots and another version to human visitors. This is called Cloaking SEO tactic. •	Using Hidden or invisible text or with the page background color, using a tiny font size or hiding them within the HTML code such as "no frame" sections. •	Repeating keywords in the Meta tags, and using keywords that are unrelated to the site's content. This is called Meta tag stuffing. •	Calculated placement of keywords within a page to raise the keyword count, variety, and density of the page. This is called Keyword stuffing . •	Creating low-quality web pages that contain very little content but are instead stuffed with very similar key words and phrases. These pages are called Doorway or Gateway Pages •	Mirror web sites by hosting multiple web sites all with conceptually similar content but using different URLs. •	Creating a rogue copy of a popular web site which shows contents similar to the original to a web crawler, but redirects web surfers to unrelated or malicious web sites. This is called Page hijacking. Always be away to adopt any of the above Black Hat tactic to improve the rank of your site. Search engines are smart enough to identify all the above proprieties of your site and ultimately you are not going to get anything.   3 SEO Website Domain When you start thinking of doing a business through internet, first thing which you think about is your web site domain name. Before you choose a domain name you should consider the followings •	Who would be your target audience? •	What you intend to sell to them. Is it a tangible item or just text content? •	What will make your business idea unique or different than everything else that is already on the market? Many people think it is important to have keywords in a domain. Keywords in the domain name are usually important, but it usually can be done while keeping the domain name short, memorable, and free of hyphens. Using keywords in your domain name give you a strong competitive advantage over your competitors. Having your keywords in your domain name can increase click through rates on search engine listings and paid ads as well as make it easier to Using your keywords in get keyword rich descriptive inbound links. Avoid buying long, and confusing domain names. May people separate the words in their domain names using either dashes or hyphen. In the past the domain name itself was a significant ranking factor but now search engines have advanced it is not very significant factor anymore. Keep two to three words in your domain name it will be more memorable. Some of the most memorable websites do a great job of branding by creating their own word. Few examples are eBay, Yahoo!, Expedia, Slashdot, Fark, Wikipedia, Google... You should be able to say it over the telephone once and the other person should know how to spell it and they should be able to guess about what you sell. Guru Mantra Finally, you should be able to answer yourself for the following questions: •	Why do you want to build your website? Why should people buy off your site and not from other site? What makes you different from others? •	Who are your target audience and what you intend to sell to them? List 5 - 10 websites which you thing, they are they amazing. Now think why are they amazing? •	Create 5 different domain names. Make at least 1 of them funny. Tell them to a half dozen people and see which ones are the most memorable. You will get more honest feedback if the people do not know you well. •	Buy your domain name which is more catchy, memorable and relevant to your business.  	  4 SEO Relevant Filename One of the simplest methods to improve your search engine optimization is to look at the way you name your files. Before writing this tutorial I did lot of research on file names and found that search engines like Google give too much importance to file names. You should think what you are going to put in your web page and then give a relevant file name to this page. Just try giving any keyword in Google search engine and you will find file names highlighted with the keyword you have given. So it simply proves that your file name should have appropriate keyword. File Naming Style •	The filename should preferably be short and descriptive. It’s always good to use same keywords in file name as well as in page title. •	Don't use file names like service.htm or job.htm but use actual service name in your file name like computer-repairing.htm •	Don't use more than 3-4 words in file name and separate them with hyphens rather than underscores. Try to use 2 keywords if possible. File Name Example Here are some file names which should be preferred from SEO as well as from user point of view. • 	slazenger-brand-balls.html • 	wimbledon-brand-balls.html • 	wilson-brand-balls.html Notice that keywords are separated by hyphens rather than underscores. Google sees file names as follows: seo-relevant-filename as seo relevant filename(good)   But Google sees seo_relevant_filename as seorelevantfilename (not good)  File Extension It should be noticed that .html, .htm and .php and any other extension do NOTHING for your visitors, and they are simply a means of offloading some of the work of configuring your webserver properly onto your visitors. In effect you are asking them to tell your webserver HOW to produce the page, not which one? Many Web masters think that it’s a good idea to use filename without using extension. It may help you but not a whole lot. URL Sub-Directory Name From Search Engine Optimization point of view URL sub-directory name hardly matters. You try giving any keyword in any search and you will not find any sub-directory name matching with your keywords. But from user point of view you should keep very much abbreviated sub-directory name. Guru Mantra Finally, I will suggest to keep the following points in mind before naming your files: •	Use web page file name short, simple, descriptive and relevant to page content. •	Try to use maximum 3-4 keywords in your file name and these keywords should be appeared in your web page title as well. •	Separate all keyword with hyphen rather than with underscore. •	Keep your sub directories name as shorter as possible. •	Keep the file size fewer than 101K though because Google chops almost everything above that.  	 5 SEO Design & Layout A web site design and layout gives first impression about your site. There are sites which are too fancy and regular net surfers will just reach on those sites and will come out even without creating a single click. Search Engines are very smart but after all they are software and not human being who will read the content of their interest. If you make your site too complicated then Search Engine would not be able to parse the content of your site properly and finally indexing would not be efficient which will result in a low rank. The actual page content should have a keyword density of about 10% and should weigh in at about 200 words - but there are as many opinions about this as there are SEO experts. Some say keyword density should be 5% and some say it should be 20%. 10% works for me. Here are few guidelines which should be considered while designing a web page. •	You should have more text content than HTML elements. •	No frames. They are the enemies of Search Engines and Search Engines are Enemies of Frames. •	No ads if possible. Because most of the ads uses Java Script which is not advised to be used. •	No JavaScript. If you need JavaScript, call it from an external file rather than dumping the code in the HTML file. JavaScript drop down menus prevent spiders from crawling beyond your homepage. If you use them, be sure to include text links at the bottom of the page. •	Nothing that does not fit perfectly into the page topic; There should be no doubt in the search engine's mind (or in he user's mind) what your page is about. • No unnecessary directories. Keep your files as close to the root as possible. •	No fancy stuff (Flash, Splash, Animated Gifs, Rollovers etc.) unless absolutely necessary.   	 CHAPTER 6 SEO Optimized Keywords We are discussing everything in Web context so in web terminology a keyword is a term that a person enters into a search engine to find specific information. Most people enter search phrases that consists of between two and five words. Such phrases may be called search phrases, keyword phrases, query phrases, or just keywords. Good keyword phrases are specific and descriptive. There are following concepts related to Keywords which helps in optimizing keywords on a web page. Keyword Frequency: This is calculated as how often does a keyword appear in a site's title or description. You don't want to go overboard with frequency, however, since on some engines if you repeat a word too many times, you'll be penalized for "spamming" or keyword stuffing. In general though, repeat your keyword in the document as many times as you can get away with, and up to 3-7 times in your META tags. Keyword Weight: This refers to the number of keywords appearing on your Web page compared to the total number of words appearing on that same page. Some search engines consider this when determining the rank of your Web site for a particular keyword search. One technique that often works well is to create some smaller pages, generally just a paragraph long, which emphasize a particular keyword. By keeping the overall number of words to a minimum, you will increase the "weight" of the keyword you are emphasizing. Keyword Proximity: This refers to the placement of keywords on a Web page in relation to each other or, in some cases, in relation to other words with a similar meaning as the queried keyword.  For search engines that grade a keyword match by keyword proximity, the connected phrase .home loans. will outrank a citation that mentions .home mortgage loans. assuming that you are searching only for the phrase "home loans". Keyword Prominence: A measure of how early or high up on a page the keywords are found. Having keywords in the first heading and in the first paragraph (first 20 words or so) on a page are best. Keyword Placement: WHERE your keywords are placed on a page is very important. For example, in most engines, placing the keywords in the Title of the page or in the Heading tags will give it more relevancy. On some engines, placing keywords in the link text, the part that is underlined on the screen in a browser, can add more relevancy to those words. Best Places to Put Keywords: Here is a list of places where you should try to use your main keywords. •	Keywords in the <title> tag(s). •	Keywords in the <meta name="description"> • 	Keywords in the <meta name="keyword"> • 	Keywords in <h1> or other headline tags. •	Keywords in the <a href="http://yourcompany.com">keywords</a> link tags. •	Keywords in the body copy. •	Keywords in alt tags. •	Keywords in <!-- insert comments here> comments tags. •	Keywords 	contained 	in 	the 	URL 	or 	site 	address, 	e.g., http://www.keyword.com/keywordkeyword.htm. Finding Keywords: There are many different ways to find keywords for your website. Some good keyword ideas are: •	Words people would search for to find your product or service. •	Problems your prospective customers may be trying to solve with your product or service. •	Keyword tags on competitors websites. •	Visible page copy on competitors websites. •	Related search suggestions on top search engines. • 	By using an online tools like: Google Keyword Tool •	By analyzing your website carefully and finding out proper keywords. This task can be done by expert SEO Copywriters. •	Pay attention to stemming for your keywords - Particularly to what the root word is and what Google considers to be a match for that word when optimizing pages over time. •	You can do brainstorming to identify correct keywords for your site. What is Word Stemming? Google uses word stemming. Word stemming allows all forms of the word - singular, plural, verb form as well as similar words to be returned for a given search query. So if someone types in "house plans", not only will pages that are optimized for that phrase be returned, but so will pages that contain all variations of that phrase, for example: "house plan", "house planning", "house planer". Hope you have some understanding on keywords and how to identify them and where to use them. Next chapter will explain you how to optimize Meta tags for better results.    	  7 SEO Optimized Meta tags There are two important Meta Tags and they are the meta description and meta keyword tags. Some search engines may display the meta description as part of the search results, but the meta keywords tags should not appear in search results. The general consensus among SEO experts is that meta tags are dead. Even so, many of these same experts continue to use meta tags in their own sites. For Google adding the Description Meta Tag won't result in a boost in the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs), but the description might be used for the description for your SERP listings in Google. Yahoo says they use the Keyword Meta Tag when it ranks a page. So it makes sense to add one for Yahoo and any other minor search engines that still use. What do the Meta Tags Look Like? You can add following in the head section of the web page: <meta name="keywords"           content="KEYWORD1 KEYWORD2 KEYPHRASE1 etc.           about 30 to 40 unique words">  <meta name="description"           content="An accurate, keyword-rich description           about 150 characters"> Meta Description Tag Tips: There are few important tips for good meta description tags: •	Use keywords in your meta description tag. •	Try not to repeat the words overly often, but try to use multiple syntaxes of your key words. •	There should not be more than 150 characters in a description meta tag of a single web page. •	Use a different meta description tag for each page, as each page is different and stands a better chance of being found if you place a good title and description on it. Meta Keywords Tag Tips: There are few important tips for good meta keywords tags. Please refer to previous chapter on identifying good keyword. •	Use synonyms •	Use unique keywords •	No need to repeat any given phrase. •	You can repeat any word an unlimited amount of time as long as each time it is part of a different phrase. Robots Meta Tag: The important Meta Tag that you may need sometime is the Robots Meta Tag which looks like this: meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow"> Using above meta tag you can tell to a spider or robot that you do not want some of your pages indexed or that you do not want your links followed.   	 8 SEO Title Optimization Hope you understand the meaning of HTML TITLE tag which is put inside head tag. The page title (not to be confused with the heading for a page) is what is displayed in the title bar of your browser window, and is also what is displayed when you bookmark a page or add it to your browser Favorites. This is the one place on a web page where your keywords MUST be present. Correct use of keywords in the title of every page of your website is extremely important to Google - particularly for the home page. If you do nothing else to optimize your site, remember to do this! The title shouldn't consist of much more than about 9 words or 60 characters, with your keywords used at the very beginning of the title. Since Google is looking for relevant keywords in the title, this means you should NOT include your company name in the title unless your company name is very well known.  Improper or nonexistent use of titles in web pages will keep more websites out of top rankings on Google than any other factor except perhaps for a lack of relevant content on a page or a lack of quality links from other websites that point to your site. Best Practices for Creating Titles: Here are some best practices you should follow for creating titles on pages: •	Each page should have a unique title. •	If practical, try to include your Primary Keyword Phrase in every title of every page. •	Begin the title of your home page with your Primary Keyword Phrase, followed by your best Secondary Keyword Phrases. •	Use more specific variations to your Primary Keyword Phrase on your specific product, service, or content pages. •	If you must include your company name, put it at the end of the title. •	Use the best form, plural or singular, for your keywords based on what WordTracker says is searched on more often. •	Don't overdo it - don't repeat your keywords more than 2 - 3 times in the title •	Make sure the <title> tag is the first element in the <head> section of your page - this makes it easier to find by Google.SEO Optimized Anchors Use descriptive anchor text for all your text links. Most search engines consider anchor text of incoming links when ranking pages. Here is an example of anchor: <a href="otherpage.htm" title="Anchor Title">Anchor Text</a> Here are following important points to notice about anchors: •	The Anchor Title plays a very important roles and will be seen by most of the search engines. So your anchor title should have appropriate keywords. Anchor title will help site visitors using a balloon and displaying written text. •	The Anchor Text is another important part which should be selected very carefully because this text will be used not only of search engines but also for the navigation purpose. You should try to use best keywords in your anchor text. •	The otherpage.htm is the link to another web page. This link could be to external site. But here care should be taken that this web page should exist otherwise it will be called a broken link and broken links give very bad impression to Search Engines as we as to site vistors. Another example of anchor could be as follows: <a href="otherpage.htm" title="Anchor Title">         <img src="image.gif" alt="keywords" /> </a> In this case Anchor Text has been replaced by an image. So while using an image in place of anchor text it should be checked that you have put alt tag properly. An image alt tag should have appropriate keywords.  	  10 Content Is The King Content is basically includes what you see on the site: the text, graphics and even links to outside world. I would condemn using excessive graphics because they are not Search Engine Friendly plus users feel irritation when they get downloaded specially over a slow network. Thousands of articles, books and forum entries detail how to make your site search engine friendly, but ultimately, one rule stands above the rest: Content is king. But I will say this rule is past now and I would like to say Unique, high-quality, unduplicated content is the king. Superior the quality of your content, the higher the ranking you achieve, larger the traffic you gain and greater the popularity of your website. Search engines prefer good quality sites in their index and search results. A relevant, fresh, and timely content is crucial to attracting and keeping visitors to your web pages. It will help you both draw traffic from search engines and create audience loyalty. Unique, High-Quality Content: When people visit a Web site for information, they want your unique spin on a topic. How is your material or content unique? Is that uniqueness obvious and easy to find and to understand? Visitors want unique, high-quality site content. Its not only your home page content but also all the linked pages should have useful and easy to understand content. Now a days search engines have become very smart and they are able to understand complete grammar and complete phrase. So while raking a page against other then it matters how rich content is available on a page. Sites with duplicated, syndicated or free content, who get given red flags by the Search Engines. SEO Content Writing ( Copy Writing ): SEO Content Writing (also referred as SEO Copy Writing) involves the process of integrating keywords and informative phrases which make up the actual content of your website. While writing your web page content following tips may help you in keeping it better than others. •	The content should be directed for the specified target audience. •	Keyword density is strictly adhered as per search engine guidelines. •	Titles should always be eye-catchers, compelling your visitors to read on and want what you have to offer in your website. •	Don't use confusing and complex language. Use small statements to make your content more understandable. •	Keep your web pages short and don't put all the content on a single page. •	Divide your web page content also into short paragraphs. Other advantages of having great content: It’s not only SEO you have to think about, but also many factors will make your site popular. •	If your site is having something really unique then people would like to suggest it to their friends. •	Other webmasters would like to create a link of your site on thier sites •	Your site visitors will start trusting on your site and they will look forward for the next content and will keep coming again and again. •	Assuming you have been listed out by any Search Engine but net surfer will click only that page whose content snippet would look more unique and interesting. Conclusion: Creating, editing, and promoting unique high-quality content is difficult and time consuming. But in the end Golden rule of SEO is that Content is the King. It’s not just because of a Search Engine but it’s for your site visitors. A page that is read by people is better than a page that is read by bots. So write your content after going a serious thought. Keep your title, keywords, link text, meta tags up-to-date and unique and interesting. I am sure you will win.  	 11 XHTML Verification for Web Site You design and develop a web site but how would you know if you have put all the HTML syntax in correct way. Almost all browser don't complain against your wrong syntax but wrong is wrong. There are many SEO experts who claim that SEO is not dependent on site HTML/XHTML verification. But I will tell you various reasons why your site should be W3C Compliance. Why HTML/XHTML Verification is Required? There are various reasons to verify your web page before hosting it over the internet. •	Any web page quality depends on how well you have written your web page. It should be syntactically correct and should pass all the Quality Gates. •	When any Search Engine does indexing for your web page content it might get confused if your HTML tags are not written properly and much of the web page content might not be indexed properly. •	There might be many HTML tags which you are using in your web page but then have been depreciated and many of the search engines also don't support them. •	Consistency, HTML Code Beauty, Process Compliance are always appreciated by good Webmasters. What Is W3C Compliance? The W3C is the World Wide Web Consortium and since 1994 the W3C has provided the guidelines by which websites and web pages should be structured and created. Here are the links to validate your web pages: •	Validate HTML/XHTML File against W3C Standard HTML/XHTML Validator. • 	Validate CSS File against W3C Standard CSS Validator. While doing verification you will get errors along with appropriate reasons. All the validations will be done using XHTML DTD which is a refined version of HTML. Rules for W3C Compliance: There are following rules which you should keep in your mind while writing your web pages. •	Use the XHTML declaration statements to start every XHTML page: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC  "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"> •	Every tag must be closed. •	The head and body tags are now mandatory. •	Empty tags get a terminating slash. An empty tag is a tag that doesn't require an end tag. Examples include <br> and <hr>. <BR> is now <br />. <HR> is now <hr />. <IMG SRC="--"> is now <img src="--" /> •	All tags must be lower case. This does not apply to attributes, only tags. For example, both of these formats are acceptable under the XHTML DTD: <FONT color="#ffffcc"> is invalid <font color="#ffffcc"> is valid <font color="#FFFFCC"> is also valid •	All the attribute values should be put with-in double quote. •	Tags may not nested <b><i>Text</b></i> This is invalid <b><i>Text</i></b> This is valid •	The <pre> tag should not contain: img, object, big, small, sub, or sup. •	One <form> tag can not be inside another <form> tag. •	If your code contains a &, it must be written as &amp;. •	Any use of CSS should use all lower case lettering.
